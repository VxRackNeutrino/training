## Introduction to

<img src="img/logo2.png" width="40%;">

### **Kubernetes** is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications

---

## Facts

* Means "helmsman" or "pilot" in Greek
* a.k.a. `k8s`
* Project started by Google in 2014
* Open source, written in Go
* Contributors
  * Google, CoreOS, RedHat, Microsoft, etc.
* Very active development
  * 40k+ commits, 19k+ stars, 6k+ forks (as of Dec 2016)

---

## Not an IaaS, nor a PaaS

<img src="img/caas.png">

#### e.g. PaaS on top of Kubernetes
 * Deis
 * OpenShift v3
 * Gondor

---

## Kubernetes does not...

* have a service marketplace
* dictate application frameworks
* restrict the language runtimes (e.g., Java, Python, Ruby)
* restrict to only 12-factor apps
* distinguish “apps” from “services”
* provide middleware (e.g. message buses, databases, caches)

---

## Some features

* Container grouping
* Load-balacing
* Self-healing
* Auto-scaling
* Health checking
* Naming and discovery
* Extensible (plugin architecture)
* ...

---

## Competition

* Docker Swarm
* Apache Mesos
* Amazon Container Service

---

## Kubernetes architecture

<img src="img/k8s_architecture_overview2.png">

---

# Key Concepts

---

## master node

* Contains the required control plane components
  * i.e. etcd, API server, scheduler, controller manager, DNS
* Contains other optional addons
  * e.g. User interface, monitoring, logging, etc.
* No official support for HA multi-master environments

### etcd

* Distributed key-value store
* Used to store the cluster state and configuration data

### API server

* Serves up the Kubernetes API
* Processes operations, validates them, and updates the corresponding objects in etcd

---

## master node (cont'd)

### Controller manager

* Runs controllers that handle routine tasks in the cluster
* Each controller is a separate thread, but run as a single process
* e.g. Node Controller, Service Account Controller, Endpoints Controller, etc.

### Scheduler

* Binds unscheduled pods to nodes
* Pluggable by design
* Applies predicates (filters) and priorities (sorting)

---

## node

* a.k.a. minion
* Worker machine in Kubernetes
* Can be a VM or a physical machine
* Has the container runtime installed (Docker by default)
* Also the `kubelet` and `kube-proxy` services

### kubelet

* Manages pods and their containers, their images, their volumes, etc

### kube-proxy

* Simple network proxy and load balancer
* Its configuration is defined by user-defined services
* Routes traffic to pods across the cluster

---

## pod

* Basic deployment unit in Kubernetes
* Contains one or more containers
* Run inside nodes
* Has a single IP address (shared by all containers)
* All containers in the pod are deployed to the same host

---

```json
{
  "kind": "Pod",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "redis-django",
    "labels": {
      "app": "webapp"
    }
  },
  "spec": {
    "containers": [
      {
        "name": "key-value-store",
        "image": "redis",
        "ports": [
          {
            "containerPort": 6379
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "frontend",
        "image": "django",
        "ports": [
          {
            "containerPort": 8000
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## label

* Key/value pair
* Attached to objects (e.g. pods)
* Specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to users
* Can be modified at any time

```json
"labels": {
  "app": "webapp",
  "environment": "dev",
  "release": "canary",
  "tier": "frontend",
}
```

---

## selector

* Core grouping primitive in Kubernetes
* Allows users to identify a set of objects
* Allows multiple requirements (comma-separated)
* empty label selector -> all objects
* null label selector -> no objects

#### Equality-based selectors

```yaml
environment = production
tier != frontend
```

#### Set-based selectors

```yaml
environment in (production, qa)
tier notin (frontend, backend)
!partition
```
---


## service

* Set of pods that are defined by the same selector
* Traffic to the service is load-balanced to pods by Kubernetes

```json
{
    "kind": "Service",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "webapp-service"
    },
    "spec": {
        "selector": {
            "app": "webapp",
            "environment": "production",
        },
        "ports": [
            {
                "protocol": "TCP",
                "port": 80,
                "targetPort": 8000
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Replication Controller

* Ensures that a specified number of pod "replicas" are running
  * too many pods -> kill some
  * too few pods -> start some
* Supervises multiple pods across multiple nodes

---

## Replication Controller (cont'd)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: webapp
    environment: production
  template:
    metadata:
      name: webapp
      labels:
        app: webapp
        environment: production
    spec:
      restartPolicy: always
      containers:
      - name: key-value-store
        image: redis
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
      - name: frontend
        image: django
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

## Networking

#### Requirements

* Pods need to communicate with each other, no matter which host they run on
* Each pod must have a unique IP in the cluster
* Containers in a pod must talk using localhost

#### Implementations

* Contiv, **Flannel**, GCE, L2 networks and linux bridging, OpenVSwitch, Weave, etc...

---

### Flannel

* Overlay network created by CoreOS
* Uses etcd to maintain a mapping between allocated subnets and real host IP addresses
* Configured with an IP range and the size of the subnet for each node
  * e.g. overlay to use 10.100.0.0/16, each node to receive a /24 subnet
  * Node A 10.100.1.0/24; Host B 10.100.2.0/24; etc.
