# Introduction

## What is a microservice?
A microservice is a small application that performs a single functionality.

## Where it goes?
A microservice should be able to run everywhere.

## How to build them?
You can use any language that provide RESTful APIs.

---
# Phylosophy

## A single microservice must be:

### - Monolithic
### - Resilient
### - Independent

---

# Monolithic

## - A single job fuction
## - A single focus

---

# Resilient

## - Failures will happen
## - High available
## - Recoverable

---

# Independent

## - Upgrade without impact

---

# Nature Examples

## - Human Cells
## - Farm Animals

???
## Human Cells
Human cells are constantly dying and contantly regenerating.  Although we dont upgrade cells (yet) the idea is that you dont stop existing as because of this process.

## Farms
Farm animals unlike pet are raised there is a lot of emotion when the family pet die, but a farm animal when it die tend to be replace by another one and the replaced one is quickly forgotten.

## 12 Factors

- I. Codebase
- II. Dependencies
- III. Config
- IV. Backing services
- V. Build, release, run
- VI. Processes
- VII. Port binding
- VIII. Concurrency
- IX. margin-bottomDisposability
- X. Dev/prod parity
- XI. Logs
- XII. Admin processes

---

## **I.** Codebase

### One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

<img src="img/codebase-deploys.png" width="40%" style="border: 0; box-shadow: none;">

---
## **II.** Dependencies

### Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.

1. Declare **dependencies** in a **manifest**
2. Use **isolation** tools
3. **Specific** versions are important

---

## **II.** Dependencies (cont'd)

**Dependency manifest**
- `Gemfile` in Ruby
- `requirements.txt` in Python

**Isolation tools**
- `bundle exec` in Ruby
- `virtualenv` in Python

**Versions**
- `gem "redis-rails", "~> 3.2.3"` (Gemfile)
- `django-redis==4.4.3` (requirements.txt)


---

## **III.** Config

### Store config in the environment

- Config is the **specific** information required to host a deployment of your codebase.
- Mainly database **credentials**, **paths**, **resource URLs**, etc.
- Keep your config **outside** the app
- No config in git - Open Source test

<br>

```
production:
  adapter: mysql2
  database: <%= ENV['DB_ENV_MYSQL_DATABASE'] %>
  username: <%= ENV['DB_ENV_MYSQL_USER'] %>
  password: <%= ENV['DB_ENV_MYSQL_PASS'] %>
  port: <%= ENV['DB_PORT'] %>
  host: <%= ENV['DB_HOST'] %>
```

---

## **IV.** Backing services

> Treat backing services as attached resources

- e.g. datastore, mail service, cache, message broker
- Allows changing of service without code changes
- Makes no distinction between **local** and **third-party** services

<img src="img/attached-resources.png" width="85%" style="border: 0; box-shadow: none;">

---

## **V.** Build, release, run

### Strictly separate build and run stages

* `BUILD` = codebase + dependencies + assets
* `RELEASE` = `BUILD` + config
* `RUN` (runtime) = run process against `RELEASE`

<img src="img/release.png" width="85%" style="border: 0; box-shadow: none;">

---

## **V.** Build, release, run (cont'd)

- **Cannot change** at **runtime**
- **Rollback** = just use previous release
- Every release has a unique **release ID**

---

## **VI.** Processes

### Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

- Processes are **stateless** and **share nothing**
- e.g. **No sticky sessions** to cache user data
- Use a stateful backing service instead, typically a datastore
- Allows **scaling out**

---

## **VII.** Port binding

### Export services via port binding

- The **contract** with the **execution environment** is binding to a **port** to serve requests.
- Allows **modularization**
- One app can become the **backing service** for another app

---

## **VIII.** Concurrency

### Scale out via the process model

- Processes can handle **own multiplexing**
- Small defined apps allows scaling as need to handle load

<img src="img/process-types.png" width="50%" style="border: 0; box-shadow: none;">

---

## **IX.** Disposability

### Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

- Processes are **disposable**
- Start **quickly**, shutdown **gracefully**
- Be robust against **sudden death**
- Changes need to take effect quickly

---

## **X.** Dev/prod parity

### Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

- **Shorten the gaps**
- Get developers **involved** in operations
- Continuous deployment requires same environment to **minimize errors**

---

## **XI.** Logs

### Treat logs as event streams

- Logs are handled **differently** depending on the **environment**
- **Don't** route or store **logs in files**
- Stream to **stdout** instead to be captured by the environment

---

## **XII.** Admin processes

### Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

- Database migrations, console, one-time scripts
- e.g. `python manage.py migrate`
- Run as **separate** process
- **Admin code** ships with **app code**
